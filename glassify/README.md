# 🧊 Glassy

**Glassy** is a lightweight and flexible Flutter widget that brings the smooth **glassmorphism** effect to your app with just a few lines of code.

If you're building a modern UI and want that frosted glass aesthetic — blur, translucency, and subtle shadows — this widget makes it dead simple.

---

## ✨ Why use Glassy?

- ⚡ Easy to integrate — drop it in and you're done
- 🎨 Fully customizable — adjust blur, border radius, shadows, colors, and more
- 🌓 Smart theme support — light and dark mode adjustments built-in
- 🚫 No deprecated methods — uses up-to-date Flutter practices
- 📦 Clean, dependency-free implementation

> Ideal for dashboards, overlays, profile cards, or anywhere you need depth and clarity.
