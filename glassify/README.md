# 🧊 Glassify

**Glassify** is a lightweight and flexible Flutter widget that brings the smooth **glassmorphism** effect to your app with just a few lines of code.

## ✨ Why use Glassify?

- ⚡ Easy to integrate — drop it in and you're done
- 🎨 Fully customizable — adjust blur, border radius, shadows, colors, and more
- 🌓 Smart theme support — light and dark mode adjustments built-in
